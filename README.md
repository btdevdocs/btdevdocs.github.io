# Introduction

Welcome fellow (or aspiring) Butler/Till technology professionals! As part of our commitment to advancing your skills, and ensuring the quality of the work we produce, we have created this document to provide general guidelines to support both. While this document is not meant to describe specific tasks required for promotion or advancement, it does provide developmental milestones that support your growth to achieve both:

In this document you will find the following:

* Common definitions and nomenclature
* Our guiding values and how we implement them
* Our structure, roles, and responsibilities for each
* Pathways to advancement for each role within the organization

This document is meant to be an organic work; as business demands change, and our technology and talent landscape diversifies, this will be continually revisited to ensure alignment with the business, and to better support your development in technology.

## Tech Organization Values

Whether operating as an individual contributor or leader, our four key values define the how we achieve excellence in our work at Butler/Till:

* **Values team success over individual success:** We are a team and not a collection of unaffiliated individuals. You may be part of several teams: your squad, your chapter, your guild(s), your tribe. Contributing to the success of each of these groups is more beneficial to the company, the product, and our customers than chasing your own success at the cost of your teams.
* **Continuously improves (self and team):** Butler/Till believes in never settling for the status quo. We are always focused on learning and growing.
Holds themselves and others accountable: As a company we value transparency and autonomy. These values must be coupled with accountability if we are to succeed. Taking responsibility for your own actions and the actions of the team and holding others to this standard is critical for us to be able to trust and work with each other.
* **Thinks about business impact:** Butler/Till is a business. If we wish to keep working within this culture that we’ve built, we need to make sure that we are aligned with that business. Understanding how the choices you make affect the company is important for your growth as a professional.
* **Mastery:** While the other characteristics talk about expectations and behaviors that are independent of your domain or role, mastery is specifically about becoming a better engineer, agile coach, technical product owner, QE, QA or TA.

## Tech Organizational Structure

Before we dive further, it is important to outline the basics of how tech teams are structured at Butler/Till, and define the general scope of each:

<ol>
  <li> Individual: At this level, you are new to working and are figuring out how to be productive and contributing member of the company.</li>
  <li> Squad / Chapter: Your primary team such as Software Engineering, Analytics, or Data Enablement. You are now a contributing member of a team and are a resource for the people you work with every day.</li>
  <li> Tribe / Guild: These are the larger teams organizationally or functionality that people are part of - for example the full chain of data delivery from aquisition to reporting. You are now a resource beyond your immediate team. Either because you have depth in a technology (and help others or other teams around that technology);
    because you are skilled at solving difficult problems that span teams; or because you can be counted on to lead other developers in your tribe to solve large cross
    squad problems.</li>
  <li>Technology / Company (the highest levels of the organization) – The developers at this level are resources for the entire company based on their technical and
    leadership skills and are expected to spend a significant amount of their time working across the organization.</li>
</ol>

# Developer Role Ladders

The BT developer advancement framework contains 4 different ladders:

* [**Citizen Developer**](CitizenDeveloper.md): non-developer role performing limited-scale development activities or working to elevate skills into a junior developer role
* [**Data Engineer**](DataEngineer.md): role also known as database developer, SQL programmer, or integration engineer requires a deep level of technical expertise relating to the aquisition, modeling, and processing of structured and unstructured data
* [**Software Engineer**](SoftwareEngineer.md): role also known as programmer or software developer, requires a deep level of technical expertise
* [**Tech Lead**](TechLead.md): role also known as dev lead, is the owner of the system and requires a unique balance between hands-on development, architecture knowledge and production support
* [**Engineering Manager**](EngineeringManager.md): role also known as dev manager, is responsible for the consistent delivery, career growth and level of happiness of the team

If you are confused about the difference between a [Tech Lead](TechLead.md) and an [Engineering Manager](EngineeringManager.md), please refer to the [Tech Lead vs Engineering Manager](TechLead-EngineeringManager.md) page for a detailed comparison.

# Axes

The chart shown above has the following 5 axes:
* **Technology**: knowledge of the tech stack and tools
* **System**: level of ownership of the system(s)
* **People**: relationship with the team(s)
* **Process**: level of engagement with the development process
* **Influence**: scope of influence of the position

The **influence** axis can be seen as a *different dimension* since it is orthogonal and applies to all the other axes.

Each axis has 5 different levels of performance. It is important to highlight that every level includes the previous one(s). For example, someone that *evangelizes* technology, *specializes* and *adopts* it as well.

Keep reading to better understand each level.

# Levels

### Technology: *Application of tools or technology to solve business challenges*

1. **Adopts**: At this step, you are actively learning and adopting the technology and tools defined by the team. This is the place where you are learning how best to apply internal tools and processes. This is the only step where there is an expectation that all members of technology should move toward the next step
2. **Specializes**: At this step, you are the go-to person for one or more technologies and actively taking initiative to learn new ones. This can take many forms, but best described as effort to be the in-house subject matter expert for a particular technology.
3. **Evangelizes**: At this step, you are actively researching and creating proofs of concept and prototypes, and working to introduce these new technologies to the team
4. **Masters**: You have thorough and very deep knowledge about the whole technology stack of the system, and are actively a reference for other employees knwledge needs surrouding it
5. **Creates**: Whole-cloth builder; You design and create new technologies that are widely used either by internal or external teams. Packages published to Pypi, Nuget, etc.

### System: *A collection of tools, purpose built with standard operating procedures and performance metrics*

1. **Enhances**: At this step, you successfully push new features and bug fixes to improve and extend a system. You understand version control and are incrementally improving specific components.

It is not expected that a member of technology would remain at this step during their entire time at butler/Till. At this step, your focus should be on growing so that you can support your team. This is the only step where there is an expectation that all members of technology should move toward the next step.
2. **Team Step (squad)**: At this step, you are a resource for your chapter or your squad, either as a domain specialist for your team, or as a generalist/problem solver for them. You should be able to lead smaller efforts coordinating with other members of your team and drive them to completion and/or dig into tough problems and solve them independently taking in feedback from your peers and focusing on the outcome.
3. **Multiple Team Step (tribe)**: At this step, you have an impact across squads or chapters. You are a resource for a larger group as a domain expert or generalist. You will lead cross-team (squad/tribe/chapter) efforts involving more people and drive them to completion and/or you will take on large challenges, working with diverse stakeholders in multiple teams to solve a problem that affects your larger organization.
